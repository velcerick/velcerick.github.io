 <h2>Adventures in Nairen<span class="subheader"></h2>
 
	<p> Neiren (nigh-ren) is a small farming village just a few miles south of the Dyossis Jungle and part of the Duchy of Haderek. It is managed on behalf of its lord by a local bailiff. Sheriff Anissa, known for her sour attitude towards adventurers, is responsible for keeping law and order in the village while Forester Cale does the same for the lumber camps in the jungle.</p>
	
	<p>Situated beyond the sheltering protection of Haderek’s Great Wall, Neiren faces dangers from the nearby Dyossis Jungle and Bog of Kresh, goblins foremost among them. Thanks to the presence of powerful residents, such as the wizard Silion, the village itself is protected, but in the Outer Homesteads, and especially the lumber camps, goblin raids are frequent.</p>
	
	<p>The Duchy of Haderek is an influential province in the Kingdom of Den, and its exports can be found in all three kingdoms which make up the Empire of the Three-Fold Throne. Constantly under threat from creatures of the Dyossis Jungle to the north, Haderek has commissioned the construction of a massive wall that will, upon completion, stretch more than 500 miles and shelter the entire northern border.</p>
	
	<p>Our adventurers each found themselves heading to this small hommlet for their own reasons.</p>
 
<strong>Part One: The Alrose Affair
	<span class="subheader"> 331 AG - Gwellin 19-21</span>
	</strong>
	<p> Heading west along the road from Two-Bridges, Rhogar and Balec came upon an overturned wagon, and rushed toward the sound of a child crying for help. Meanwhile, Faylen and Starling were headed south from the jungle, but immediately recognized the scene for what it was, a trap set by goblins. There was a brief melee before the goblins were driven off or killed and the two pairs of adventurers realized they were each seeking the same wizard in the same small village. </p>
	
	<p>Upon arrival at the village of Nairen they saw smoke rising from one of the outer homesteads. Hoping to help, they ventured to the smoke and found the home of the Alrose family in ruin, several members dead. They were able to save one member and capture a small goblin called Krenurt, and learned that the farm had been attacked by giants and goblins looking for a book. They returned to the village where they learned Silion was out of town.</p>
	
	<p>Not content to sit idly they investigated the events at the Alrose farm more closely, ultimately learning that the giants were receiving intelligence from a lumberjack called onethumb. They found him and learned that the giants had attacked the Alrose farm by mistake, and that they were currently headed to the Elerose farm. Once again, the adventurers intervened, finding a giant and a small group of goblins in the process of raiding the homestead. After a very hard-fought battle against the giant, they emerged victorious. They found a small lockbox containing a mask and robe associated with a cult, but no book. They returned to town to await Silion's return.</p>

<strong>Part Two: The Folly of Youth
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Gwellin 24-25</span>
	</strong>
	<p> Only a few days after the events at the Alrose and Elerose farms, the adventurers find themselves once again called to action. While drinking in the local tavern, a young boy named Walcott Norion arrived in the farm claiming his friend Mathius Ballister was in grave danger at someplace called "the honeycomb" after a bear attack. Though they questioned his story, they did believe the bit about his friend being in danger, and agreed to help. They traveled to the Honeycomb and discovered evidence of a serious injury and the boy gone, apparently having staggered away to the east.</p>
	
	<p> His trail ultimately was picked up by some goblins who apparently picked him up and headed home. Following their trail was easy, and the band had the help of a runty goblin named Plyx, who informed them he was from a nearby abandonded keep which had recently been visited by a giant named Beszar who appointed himself king of the erstwhile independent goblin clan. Finding the keep was not difficult, though getting in and moving through it's trapped halls proved daunting, sapping the health and strength of the adventurers.</p>
	
	<p>So it was they came to Beszar's "throne room," where he lounged with a great snake coiled about his arms, in a weakend state. Though they fought valiantly, killing the serpent and leaving Beszar greivously injured, all appeared lost for the adventurers as they fell one by one to his wicked claws or the venom of his pet. Yet, as the cowardly Krenurt, who had been taking refuge in the entry to the chamber, and who had been completely overlookd by Beszar, watched the last of his companions fall, anger burned inside of him. Before he was even truly aware of what he was doing, he had knocked and loosed an arrow from his tiny bow, an arrow which found its mark in one of Bezar's grotesquely deformed ears. The giant's arm, raised to strike a killing blow against Balec, fell limply to his side, he took a few steps and turned toward Krenurt, a look of bafflement in his eyes, just before he toppled to the ground dead.</p>
	
	<p>After this somewhat inauspicious victory, the adventurers returned to Nairen after recovering the comatose body of Mathius Ballister and delivering it to Ardrenai. </p>

<strong>Sidebar: The King in Red
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Gwellin 30</span>
	</strong>
	<p> As the group continued to wait for the arrival of Silion, the holiday of Sudoc drew near. Two-Bridges, the town Balec and Rhogar call home, is known to have a very lively Sudoc festival. The adventurers, along with several locals and lumbermen decided to head to the village to join in the festivities. They befriended a woman named Ashny, her fiance Issv, and her mother Tarily along the way. There was much drinking and merriment on the first day of the journey.</p>
	
	<p>A horde of zombies emerged from the jungle in the middle of the night on the first night of the journey. Several people were killed or dragged away, and though the adventurers were able to save several people as well as staying alive themselves, the mood of the journey became sour. In the morning, all but a handful had departed, and the adventurers continued on toward Grimborough. It would not be until they returned from that city that they would realize they'd never been headed to Grimborough in the first place.</p>
	
	<p>Upon arriving in Grimborough on Sudoc's Eve, Issv and Ashny departed, telling the adventurers they planned to head to a tavern they owned called the Dead Jester, and that they could come see them later. From that moment on, everything became a nightmare. It turned out that they had not come to the Grimborough they knew, but a sort of twisted version of the city in a place called Tsar Noar, the domain of the fabled Baloch, the King in Red. One horrific event piled upon another in the dreadful realm, and the adventurers barely escaped with their lives and sanity in-tact. Though their memories of their time in Tsar Noar sometimes feel like a dream, the axe now carried by Rhogar, those still missing from Nairen and Two-Bridges, and the eerie presence of the shadowstone all serve as reminders that the events therein were all too real.</p>

<strong>Part Three: The Man in Purple
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Onnin 8-9</span>
	</strong>
	<p> Though usually a time of merriment, the normally raucous Sudoc holiday was muted in Nairen and Two Bridges following the disappearance of several townsfolk and lumbermen, as well as the return of the group with the corpse of Ashny. In addition, raids by goblins, undead sightings, and other strange occurrences were on the rise in Nairen, keeping Anissa and the few guards in the town busy at all hours of day and night. As the group dragged themselves down into the common room of the Greenbriar after the final night of Sudoc celebrations, they were greeted with a message from Handel that Anissa had been by earlier in the morning, and asked that they meet her at her office.</p>
	
	<p> Tired, and perhaps a little hung over, the group ate breakfast then departed to visit the sheriff. There, she asked them to accompany her to the Emory farm and help her escort the family back to Nairen. She gave little in the way of explanation other than she believed that the family was in danger and that the town guards were all out on other business.</p>
	
	<p>After some discussion the group agreed to accompany her, encountering first a small company of bandits that were subdued and left to be collected later. They then continued on to find the Dremmel farm had been the site of some grisly murder, and was now infested with living shadows. After a very hard-won battle against the apparitions, Anissa agreed to rest while the group recovered their strength before continuing onto the Emory farm. She had a frank conversation with the group at the time, grudgingly acknowledging that, despite her misgivings, they had been a boon to the small village and helped in a time of growing troubles. She offered to deputize the group and offer them the deed to a small homestead that had been abandoned during the Sudoc disappearances. The writ would need to be accompanied by an official title, and the group settled on Krenurt's Crew in honor of the goblin who they had saved and who, in return, had saved them.</p>
	
	<p>After spending a couple hours resting up and conversing, the group continued onto the Emory farm. There they were assaulted by a mysterious man in purple, who alluded to a master named Vanya and placed a curse upon Anissa. The group fought off the undead and the necromancer, who ultimately summoned a horrific beast of blood and sinew to chase down Beatrice Emory. Krenurt's Crew split, with Rhogar and Krenurt hanging back to mop up the undead while the rest chased the beast, catching and dispatching it just before it was able to kill Beatrice Emory. After returning to the home, Abraham took custody of his injured wife and though he was grateful at first, the group became a bit hostile toward Beatrice and the family and ultimately returned to Nairen with Anissa only, intending to come back and question the Emory family after she recovered.</p>
	
	<p>It was not to be, however, for when they returned to Nairen and brought Anissa to Ardrenai they were tasked with gathering a magical component from the mountains to the north. She had used the remainder of it tending to the Walcott boy, and feared that Anissa would require constant care to prevent her condition from deteriorating while she awaited the return of the Crew with the pure water. Thus the group was once again rushed into yet another adventure, with little time for rest or recuperation.</p>

<strong>Part Four: Bearskin
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Onnin 10-21</span>
	</strong>
	<p> The expedition to recover the pure water was one fraught with peril. They overcame trolls and manticores, fled from a wyvern, and met the renowned trader Big Gut. Upon reaching the secluded vale containing the Dark Forest they encountered a tribe of kobold hunters roasting a great one-armed troll. Though Rhogar made an effort to parley with them, they were treacherous, and believing the dragonborn to be alone attacked him as he left their camp. This, it turned out, was an unwise decision, for the crew dealt handily with the kobolds before pressing onto Flix's cottage.  </p>
	
	<p>A strange tale was to be had at the cabin of the reclusive woodsman Flix. The tale came from Flix's youngest daughter, Raine. She explained that her sister Dew was in mourning, for she had recently discovered that her long-lost love Keegan had been killed by a beast in a cave. Though the tale was confusing at first, you slowly learned that Dew and Keegan had fallen in love some years ago, but that he abandoned her, leaving only a note that he would one day return. Throughout this, the crew sensed there was more to the story and pressed Raine, who ultimately admitted that Keegan had transformed into the beast, and was not actually dead, but that he had abandoned her sister some years ago and deserved no mercy. Dew, for her part, refused to engage when you brought up the beast, lost in her mourning.</p>
	
	<p>Still somewhat bewildered by the odd tale, the Crew headed to the great tree where the beast was last seen. Some kobolds stood guard outside the tree, but were dispatched swiftly before they confronted the beast. Upon spotting the beast, standing beneath the bowl of the tree, in front of a pool of what could only be pure water, they realized that Keegan had not been transformed, but was still a man, albeit a grotesquely filthy one. They briefly tried to speak with Keegan, but he appeared to have gone over to the wild. A fight ensued, and though he was strong, Keegan was overcome, but not killed.</p>
	
	<p>Before waking the wild man they fed him pure water, which they determined had a calming effect. He told an astounding tale, that he had been a soldier, but when peace came he had no ambition, and found himself destitute and ready to give up on life. In the deepest depths of his despair he was approached by a mysterious stranger, a stranger he would later learn was none other than the god Saeth. The stranger offered Keegan a deal. If he could spend seven years without bathing, without tending to his hygiene in any way, he would be free from his struggles, wealth untold would be his. He took the deal, but only a few weeks into his seven years he came upon bandits attacking Dew and her father and intervened. The two fell in love, but Keegan knew it could not last, and thus he abandoned Dew, though remained forever in her shadow, slowly giving himself over to his inner beast.</p>
	
	<p>When Saeth came to fulfill his end of the bargain, Keegan had lost his mind and, at the time, it seemed the good of trickery had won. That was, until the Crew came and reminded him he was a man. They cleaned him up and, after a brief internal squabble over the fate of Saeth's Emerald Cloak, returned him to be reunited with his beloved. Flix and Dew were grateful for his return, and though Raine seemed bitter at first, when she heard his tale she too warmed to the "beast" that was Keegan. They enjoyed a dinner together and a night in a comfortable cottage before setting out with the pure water in the morning.</p>

<strong>Part Five: The Battle of Nairen
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Onnin 22</span>
	</strong>
	<p> Krenurt's Crew returned to a Nairen in chaos upon their return to the region with the pure water in hand. From the outer homesteads Barnolf told them they had spotted a force making its way toward the small, poorly defended village, and offered them the use of several horses as well as assistance in defending the village. Pressing hard, the crew reached Nairen shortly after the arrival of the advance force of goblins and goblinoids to find them working on causing general chaos. Fires were being set and people were panicking in the streets. </p>
	
	<p>They leapt into action, first saving a small boy and sounding the alarm bell that would call for help from nearby military outposts. Next they moved toward the food stores, where a different group of outsiders seemed to be defending the warehouses. Upon arrival at the village proper they split up, with Krenurt and Belac heading to check on Ardrenai while the others worked to quell the chaos in the streets and get townsfolk secured inside of the Greenbriar. Shortly they all had gathered at the Greenbriar along with Ardrenai and more than half of the village where they drove off any of the advance raiders and worked on hardening their defenses. To the north, it was clear that some smaller conflict was occurring at Wrothe Manor.</p>
	
	<p>The Crew waited with trepidation for the main body of the invading force to arrive, hoping they could hold out for military reinforcements. Wave after wave of goblin and giant assaulted the fortified tavern, and from the rooftops Faylen and Starling confirmed that there were struggles occurring at Wrothe Manor and Wrathclaw Tower. Then Tulkor arrived.</p>
	
	<p>Standing some twenty-five feat tall, the massive giant called out the "heroes" defending the town and was met with both Krenurt's Crew and the previously sighted adventuring group. Battle was joined, with the forces of the enemy gathered to watch. The battle against the giant was hard-faught, with members of both groups falling to his mighty scythe-like claw. Finally Belac dealth the decisive blow, and moments before the army of assembled goblins and giants swept in to finish off the heroic adventuring groups a great ball of fire erupted in their ranks and a horn sounded from the south. In moments the invaders were driven off by powerful magic and a contingent of calvary.</p>
	
	<p>Exhausted and nursing their wounds, both of the adventuring groups made their way into the Greenbriar.</b>

<strong>Part Six: The Kaj'Talel
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Onnin 23-25</span>
	</strong>
	<p>Upon waking the morning after the battle of Nairen, Krenurt's Crew found an invitation to dinner awaiting them from none other than Silion Tuldaril himself, the elusive wizard they had long been waiting on. After spending a day helping out around the village in the aftermath of the battle, they answered the invitation in person, where they finally met Silion and heard his tale. </b>
	
	<p>Most significantly, Silion informed the players that the book which had caused so much trouble was an artifact called The Book of Terniel, said to have the ability to grant those who read it their fondest desire. One of Silion's prized possessions, he had long resisted the temptation to unlock and read the book, but just a few short weeks earlier he succumbed to boredome and curiosity. Almost at once he knew he had made a mistake, for when the book was openend it released a great surge of magical energy, a surge that was sure to draw unwanted attention. Choosing not to read the book after all, he reset the arcane locks and wardings and returned it to its place in his collection. He had a meeting with the King of Den that he needed to depart for immediately, and when nobody showed up in Nairen in the next few days he hoped the danger had passed. He hired some mercenaries to guard his tower just in case, then departed for Grimborough.</p>
	
	<p>It was not to be, however, for the book was stolen shortly after his departure. His assistant Pruet informed him via magical means of the theft, and he instructed her to put out the call for adventurers. Upon his return during the Battle of Nairen he was able to learn more about the thieves, including their likely involvement in the demon cult the Kaj'Talel and the inclusion of a member of the Norion household. He tasked the crew to find the book in exchange for gold and magical services, as well as agreeing to investigate the artifact discovered by Starling and Faylen.</p>
	
	<p>Circumstances surrounding the theft immediately brought to mind Mathius Ballister, who had lost his hand around the same time as the theft, wherein a severed hand was discovered. The crew questioned him, and he openly cooperated, giving up the names of Cherise Farn and Walcott Norion, and indicating that there were two other female cultists and one male - referred to as "The Master" - whose identities remained unknown. Following these leads they first visited the home of Cherise Farn, whose family believed her to be out of town visiting relatives, then moved onto the Norion homestead outside of town. There they met with a large force of zombies and skeletons who had decimated the Norion family, killing all but Walcott and one other before the crew intervened. In the aftermath of the battle they discovered the journal of Walcott Norion, which chronicled his recruitment and descent into a full fledged cultist over a time period of approximately ten years. Most importantly, they learned that the secret hideout of the cult was housed in the old iron mines north of town.</p>
	
	<p>The Crew returned to Nairen, giving Walcott and his sister Chel over to the custody of Ardrenai and Anissa, filling in the latter on their discovery. Still recovering, she could not join them, but encouraged them to investigate the mines and take care in doing so. In the old mines the crew found evidence of a recent giant attack as well as finding the master and his demon servant. Though the master attempted escape, he was thwarted by Starling's magic and ultimately defeated, revealed to be none other than Baliff Menendil Umbalin. Unfortunately, the book was gone, apparently taken by the giants. As they made to return to Nairen, the necromancer's apprentice Varemar made his third and final appearance, demanding the return of the book and refusing to hear any suggestion that it had not been recovered. Though weakened by their confrontation with the demon, Krenurt's crew defeated Varemar and his minions with relative ease, returning to Nairen with no book, and no clear direction.</p>

<strong>Interlude: The Oozelord
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Onnin 26 - Rhaenin (Dec) 8</span>
	</strong>
	<p>Following the revelations that the bog giants had likely taken the Book of Terniel, Krenurt's Crew had a bit of time to pursue their own interests. This downtime finally gave Belac the opportunity to return to Da-Nai keep to liberate the goblins, something he'd been talking about since the crew first encountered Beszar. Grudgingly the rest of the crew followed along. They were surprised to find the keep taken over by someone calling himself "the oozelord" and subsequently finding the keep itself infested with oozes, slimes, and jellies of every sort. After fighting through literal muck, they confronted the oozelord and came out victorious, if not somewhat worse for wear. Moving on to the rest of the cavern they found and cleared a small nest of giant spiders and liberated the remaining goblins, a group of about fifteen survivors. </p>
	
	<p>Over the next several weeks Belac and Starling spent most of their time at the keep, clearing the remnants of the ooze from the caverns and working to prepare the foundation of the old keep for its  restoration. Much of this was left to Starling, who used her druidic powers to summon aid in the form of animals as well as coaxing the plants and trees to move into areas more beneficial for defense and hiding. Belac, meanwhile, focused on solidifying his leadership of the goblins and establishing himself as their boss. The goblins were surprisingly receptive to a leader who trained by teaching and delagating rather than by beating and shouting, and within short order the goblins were working independently and training regularly. </p>
	
	<p>During this time Rhogar came and went between the keep, Nairen, and other nearby villages gathering information and spreading word that goblins could be sent to the keep. He learned little about the giants, though he was able to confirm that the home of the giants was somewhere in the swamp. In addition, he heard that there were settlements of various creatures to be found in the swamp, and one of these, a goblin city called Faeldum, was said to be somwhere relatively near the border of the swamp. In addition, he heard from almost everyone that the swamp was dangerous, infested with all sorts of dangers ranging from noxious gasses to swarms of giant insects to Grimtooth himself. </p>
	
	<p>Faylen left the keep shortly after helping to liberate the goblins to seek information from her people. To the surprise of almost everyone, Krenurt asked to tag along. The two returned to Nairen after several weeks, claiming to have some information to share to get them started on the hunt for the book once again, bringing us to today. </p>

<strong>Part Seven: A Tale of Two Cities
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Rhaenin 8 - Rhaenin 17</span>
	</strong>
	<p>Krenurt's Crew reconvened regarding the book following the return of Faylen from her people. They shared what information they had gathered, having learned that there were three potential leads toward the giant's secret city of Morrowhome. First, the goblin city of Faeldum, a relatively short distance into the swamp. The second, the goblin city of Muktarm, which intelligence suggested had been taken over by giants some time ago and could potentially be hostile. Third, Lykochee, the home of the reclusive moguren. The path of least resistance seemed to be Faeldum, as it was near and they were already beginning to be known among the goblins of the region.</p>
	
	<p>Faeldum turned out to be as hostile as they were warned. One of the local crime lords, Braer, overheard the crew asking questions and sent out a small force of assassins to kill them. They fought off the attack, drawing the attention of yet another local boss, Leich, in the process. This second boss offered them knowledge and safety in return for causing some more trouble for Braer. The Crew took only minimal convincing, heading out the next day to clear out a hideout of Braer's thugs and rescue a couple of prisoners from their keeping. One of these prisoners, Sslake, suggested that there was a goblin, Khonta, in Muktarm who might know the way to the giant's home of Morrowhome.</p>
	
	<p>As hostile as Faeldum was, Muktarm was worse by many degrees. The Crew had to force their way past guards to get in, and spent the majority of their time hiding out in the home of Plyx, a goblin they did a favor for long ago. Eventually they were connected with a resistance of sorts that wanted to free Muktarm from the oppression of the Bog Giants, a resistance who knew where to find Khonta. Shortly after rescuing the goblin the Crew found themselves holed up in the resistance hideout, waiting for things to die down. Unfortunately, they were betrayed, and several large worm-like creatures were driven into the hideout, followed by a hobgoblin champion. Though the battle against the worms proved deadly to several goblins and nearly to some members of the Crew, they ultimately emerged victorious and were able to make their escape from Muktarm with the entire resistance in tow. </p>

<strong>Interlude: A Purr-fect Holiday
	<span class="subheader">331 AG - Rhaenin 18 - Rhaenin 19 (?)</span>
	</strong>
	<p>Having decided to return to Faeldum to learn more about the location of Solostrace and see how the monsters celebrate the Yule season, Krenurt's Crew set off from Muktarm with the entirety of the goblin resistance in tow. On the night before their arrival at Faeldum, a cold wind blew into the camp, and the party found themselves whisked away to the magical realm of the Frostmoors. Here they faced a pack of frightful Wendigo, survived a blizzard, rescued an ela from a band of sinister Frost Elves, and departed with a group of the Yule Lad Stufur's tomten to meet Mother Winter herself.</p>
	
	<p>As night began to fall, and the great Yule Cat Jolakaturiin massacred the unfortunate humanoids whose protection was given up to the Crew, Rhogar told everyone to join hands. Unsure what was happening, they acquiesed, and the Crew, along with their ela companion, found themselves pulled back into the mists of the Bog of Kresh near nightfall. Deep exhaustion clawed at them, and both thirst and hunger pained them, but they took a moment to question Rhogar, learning he had harnessed the power of the Shadowstone to both bring them into the Frostmoors as well as to enact their esecape.</p>
